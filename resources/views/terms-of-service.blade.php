                                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall
                                not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service operate to
                                the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of Our rights and
                                Service obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any
                                loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond Our reasonable
                                control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined
                                to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
                                deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does not affect the validity and
                                enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
                                employment or agency relationship created between You and Us as a result of these Terms
                                of Service or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Service will not be
